# Get started

Online's Design System, simply dubbed Design System (DS), is made by us at [dotkom](https://github.com/dotkom/) for [Online](https://online.ntnu.no/).

The components in DS are designed with consistency in mind, and our main goal is to make it easier for dotkom to develop web pages that adhere to Online's style.

Like the vast majority of our projects, DS is readily available open-source on GitHub [here](https://github.com/dotkom/design-system/).

## Install

Add DS to your project

`yarn add @dotkomonline/design-system`

### **Use**

Import components you want into your UI

`import { Message } from ‘@dotkomonline/design-system’;`

and use them like so

```
  const example = () => (
    <div>
      <Message type="success">It just works!</Message>
    </div>
  )
```

### Contribute to DS

Like the vast majority of our projects, DS is readily available open-source on GitHub [here](https://github.com/dotkom/design-system/).

Follow the instructions in the README.md to set up DS locally, and engage in jolly co-operation!
